# Authenticating requests

To authenticate requests, include an **`Authorization`** header with the value **`"Bearer {YOUR_AUTH_KEY}"`**.

All authenticated endpoints are marked with a `requires authentication` badge in the documentation below.

To obtain your token, authenticate by calling the /oauth/token endpoint with your credentials.

# Vacation Plan Application

## Introduction

The Vacation Plan application is designed to manage vacation plans efficiently. It includes features like managing holidays, generating API documentation, and secure authentication. This document provides a complete guide to set up and run the application locally.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose must be installed.
- A code editor or terminal to interact with the application.

## Setting up the Project Locally

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CaioCLDias/vacation-plan.git
```

### Step 2: Create the Environment File

In the root directory of the project, create an `.env` file by copying the `.env.example` file. This file contains the essential configurations for the application.

This .env file contains the configuration variables that the application requires to run properly. Ensure you have updated the necessary variables before starting the application.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Step 3: Build and Run Docker Containers

Once you have set up the `.env` file, you can build and run the project using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

When you run this command, Docker will:

- Create a container for the application.
- Create a container for the PostgreSQL database.
- Run the migration and seeders.
- Generate Passport keys for authentication.

### Step 4: Access the Application

- The application will be accessible at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).
- API documentation can be accessed at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs).
- On the homepage ([http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)), you will find the credentials for testing, including email, password, `client_id`, and `client_secret`.

## Authentication Method

The application uses Laravel Passport for authentication. It supports Password Grant tokens, which are used to authenticate API requests.

## Seeding Data

The project contains seeders to populate the database with default data:

- The **Admin User** is created automatically via a seeder.
- You can use the credentials of the Admin User for testing purposes.
- The Holiday Plans table is populated with 10 fake entries generated by the seeder.

## Running Unit Tests

The application includes unit tests that validate the functionality of key features. These tests focus on ensuring that requests are processed successfully when expected.
To run the unit tests, use:

```bash
docker exec -it vacation-plan-app php artisan test --testsuite=Unit
```

## Application Features

1. **Manage Vacation Plans**: Create, view, and manage vacation plans.
2. **API Documentation**: API endpoints are documented using Scribe and accessible at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs).
3. **Authentication**: Secure authentication is managed using Laravel Passport.

## Technologies Used

- **Laravel 11** for backend development.
- **PostgreSQL** as the database.
- **Docker** for containerization.


## Notes

- The application runs entirely in Docker containers.
- Make sure that you have the Docker environment set up properly before running the commands.
- If you encounter issues, refer to the logs by running:

```bash
docker-compose logs
```
